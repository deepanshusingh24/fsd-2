# Experiment 1: SPA vs MPA Project

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Implementing Routing in SPA**
   - Master the implementation of client-side routing to create seamless navigation between different views and pages without server requests.

2. **Component-Based Development**
   - Develop skills in building reusable, modular React components and understanding component composition for maintainable applications.

3. **State Management and Route Parameters**
   - Learn to manage application state effectively within a SPA and handle route parameters for dynamic content rendering across different components.

4. **Performance and User Experience Benefits**
   - Understand how SPAs reduce network traffic, provide faster navigation, and deliver a smoother user experience compared to traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs).

5. **Understanding SPA Architecture**
   - Learn how SPAs dynamically load content without full page reloads, improving user experience and application responsiveness.
